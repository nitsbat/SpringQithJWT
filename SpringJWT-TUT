JWT is pronounced as JAWT (jaat)
It stands for JSON web token and used for managing authorisation.
It is a URL means of representing a user credentials/identity to be transferred between two parties.


There are two types of authorisation
1) Session based token
2) JSON web token i.e JWT - It's a token with JSON value.

They both uses HTTP which is a stateless protocol. It means every interaction we made through http should contain all the
information for that interaction to happen. Nothing is remembered from before like no state is maintained over multiple request.
It means that if we have a static web page suppose and we want to access it, the user will just provide the url and will get
the page from the server and hence http works fine here. But now if there is dynamic web app we want authorisation in which
we have to send the url and identity i.e url+identity.
for example if we have two servers(microservice for example) and the client is sending some request with url+identity to which
http responses like "yes you are a user with identity , this is my response".
But again if the same client is asking for some resource by sending the url and not identity, it will not work as http doesnot
maintain the state of that first request. hence the server will ask for identity like "who are you.?"

But you will be wondering that it doesn't happen in real scenario ryt. While i am using the banking app the server only requires
my identity for the first time and then it goes until my session timed out ryt.
So this is because of tokens which can either be Session token or JWT.

************************************** Session Token **************************************
It is the most popular mechanism for authentication in most of the applications.
In session token whenever a user/client is authenticated in a server, the server stores the session(credentials and identity)\
with the session id in a lookup table / session table and provide the response to the user with the corresponding session id.
Now when the user wants to access or request any other resource from the server, it will just give the session id to the
server and the server will look for that id in the session lookup table.
Here when the server provided the client with the session id for the first time, the client saves that generally in a "cookie".

Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer
as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your
web browsing experience.Data stored in a cookie is created by the server upon your connection.
This data is labeled with an ID unique to you and your computer.

So generally this is how the Session tokens works and it is the most adopted method as of now.

Now the problem with this model is like the client or user assumes that there will be only monolithic server like there
will be only one server but that was not the case in modern application.

Todays application looks like below :
                               _____________________________> Web server 1
         url+identity          |
User ------------------->  Load Balancer -------------------> Web server 2
                               |_____________________________>Web server 3

So the problem here is while accessing a resource form web server 1, the user will be given a session id in response by
web server 1 while sotring the session info in its lookup table.
But if the same user wants the resource or something from web server 2, user will give the session id but the web server2
will not have any session info corresponding to that id cozz that id+session is stored in web server lookup table. Hence
One solution can be like we can have in memory cache like redis connected to all three web servers and then asking session
from this cache table. Well it will work but here we have a problem of one point failure. So to avoid this we use JWT model.

************************************** JSON Web Token **************************************

Now In JWT what happens is that instead of giving a session id as response, the server gave all the session information
to the user.  This can be seen as the server has authenticated the user one time and gave it the session info with the valid
signature of it and then ask user, while requesting any other resource just give this info with signature to authenticate.
Hence all the authentication details will now be with user and the server just has to check the signature.

The signature is for so that no other invalid user can authenticate by duplicating the session details.
Now this signature and all this session info is generally given as a JSON to the user. Hence JWT is the name.

****************** TO SUMMARISE :- Session Token is a reference based token while JWT is a value based token ***************

**************** Structure of JWT *********************************

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XbXkVdoG_0&list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTYTEooakHchTGglSvkZAjnE&index=12

If we see the structure of JWT it somewhat looks like this
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ
.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

We can judge like it is encrypted or some type of encoding is done in it but if we look carefully it has three dots or parts
we can say. So actually it consist of three parts

1)Header - before the first dot. base64encoded
2)Payload - between the first and second dot. base64encoded
3) Signature - last part

If we decode the encryption we will get each JSON like

Header as
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

PAYLOAD:DATA
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "iat": 1516239022
}

VERIFY SIGNATURE
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  your-256-bit-secret
) secret base64 encoded

So if we will look individually the header part just have the type and algorithm type. the payload data would be name,
subject and the time at request is made. It doesn't contain any sensitive information like username and password.
 the final part would be the signature we talked about and it is a combination
of the header+payload+secret_key. This secret key is generated by the server and is unique and hence even if a hacker
or someone knows the payload and header, it would be difficult to get the secret key.

So The structure of JWT is basically open but the signature makes it a unique one. The client will send this encryption for
every next authorisation.
So the steps involved in JWT is :

1) Client will provide userId/password to the server.
2) Authentication is done by the server and server creates the JWT. Remember JWT is not for authentication.
3) Server sends JWT to client and client saved it on the local storage or in a cookie.
4) On subsequent request the client send this JWT to server through the HTTP header. HTTP header is key value pairs where
    the key would be Authorization here and the value would be Bearer+JWT, hence
       Authorisation : Bearer+JWT
5) Server then checks the header and validate the signature. It at first converts the Header and payload into base64 and then
   computes the signature by using its secret key and then compare it with its own.

Now what if someone steals my JWT and use it for authentication purpose. We have to be careful of how we will be sending JWT
It should be an https connection and it has been similarisation with other authentication and authorisation solution.
One of the most common is OAuth which comes with its own security reasons so that people can't steal JWT.
The disadvantage of JWT is someone if steals our JWT succesfully. In session token we can tell that our token has been stolen
and say to server like please diable, then the server will delete that session from its session table.
In JWT cases, We can ofcourse setup the blacklisted JWT's i.e the server will have a list of blacklisted JWT's
as soon as you told the server that my JWT is stolen , the server will add that session info to the blacklisted JWT and as
as a result it will not authorise any further user with that JWT.
